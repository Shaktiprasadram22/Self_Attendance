# Self Attendance App â€” MVP Version

The Self Attendance App is a mobile-first tool that lets users manually track their attendance. You can add subjects, mark your daily status (Present, Absent, Holiday, Sick Leave, Half Day), and instantly view subject-wise and overall attendance percentages.

2. Mark daily attendance  
3. Bulk select subjects

## Getting Started (Backend)

- Prerequisites: Node.js 18+
- Create `.env` (already included):

```
MONGO_URI=<your mongo connection string>
PORT=5000
```

- Install deps:

```bash
npm install
```

- Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: For the MVP, the frontend stores data locally in the browser. The backend is scaffolded for future features and currently exposes placeholder endpoints under `/api/attendance`.
